<p>The Matterhorn Swiss Club was founded in 1953. At that time, its main purpose was to be able
to obtain inexpensive charter flights to Switzerland. Now, we are currently a social club and
hold several outings and events throughout the year. This enables us to get together with other
members and guests, as well as enjoy good meals and visit interesting places.</p>
<p>Our main events are:</p>
<p>
	<b>February:</b>Annual general meeting and dinner.<br>
	<b>June:</b> Spring outing, usually consisting of a nice walk or visit to a place of interest followed by a good dinner.<br>
	<b>August:</b>Helping out at the Swiss National Day Celebrations at Mont-Sutton.<br>
	<b>August:</b>Summer picnic and barbeque.<br>
	<b>September / October:</b>We often have a fall outing, but it may not be every year. Again, this usually consists of and nice walk or visit to a place of interest followed by a good dinner.<br>
	<b>November:</b>Brief meeting and dinner.<br>
	We enjoy getting together, being amongst friends and having a good time. New members are always welcome.<br>
