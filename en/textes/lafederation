<p>The Federation of Swiss Societies has, as its mandate, the
promotion of Swiss culture and events on behalf of its Member
and Affiliate Clubs and Societies. The primary such event is the
organisation and staging of the Swiss National Day celebration
which is held annually since 1977 on Mount Sutton, in the Eastern
Townships. The event is staged on the Saturday that falls closest
to August 1st.</p>
<p>The Members of the Federation are the many Swiss Clubs and
Organisations in whose interest the Federation acts. Its Committee
consists of individuals elected from among the member clubs and
societies.</p>
