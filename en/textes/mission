<h2 class="aproposTitre">our mission</h2>
<p>The Federation of Swiss Societies in Eastern Canada (FEDE) is
an umbrella organization of Swiss Clubs in Eastern Canada. Its
Committee consists of maximum 15 members, which are elected at
its annual General Meeting in January by the member clubs. There
are no individual members in the FEDE.</p>

<p>The FEDEâ€™s main purpose is to organize the yearly National day
celebration in Sutton in close cooperation with the member clubs.
Furthermore, the FEDE also provides a Main Event Calendar to the
Swiss Community where they can look up scheduled events from
all participating Swiss Clubs in Eastern Canada in one central place.
The FEDE also serves as an intermediary between the member
clubs and provides a platform for them to announce, advertise and
coordinate their events.</p>
